## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to predict the yearly amount spent by customers based on various features, including email address, avatar, average session length, time on the app, time on the website, and length of membership. We employ linear regression as our predictive modeling technique.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis contains the following columns:

- Email Address
- Avatar
- Avg. Session Length
- Time on App
- Time on Website
- Length of Membership
- Yearly Amount Spent

## Dependencies

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter (for running notebooks)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
